								The robotics club is one of our school's STEM
								club and aims to offer students skills,
								confidence, and experience in the ever growing
								field of STEM. Our clubs main focus at the
								moment is participating in the FIRST Tech
								Challenge, a competition where students design,
								build, program, and operate robots to compete in
								a head-to-head challenge. However, we have plans
								to start hosting workshops that will teach
								students the basics of CAD, programming, and
								robotics parts.
